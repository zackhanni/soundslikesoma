> Zack was a delight to work with.  He has great ideas to contribute to your music, but is equally respectful of your own vision.  I play in a three-piece rock band, and Zack worked with us to get the best possible sound on all instruments and vocals.  

It's clear that he knows his craft, and it is impressive to watch him work on recordings.  I would highly recommend Soma to artists of all genres.  We hope to work with him again in the future.
