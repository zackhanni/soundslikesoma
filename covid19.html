<h1>Working Safely at Soma Sounds during COVID 19</h1>

<h2>What you need to know before coming to the studios</h2>


<p>Soma staff clean and disinfect the studios and booth areas on a regular basis between every session. Artists and guests are asked to arrive and continue wearing face masks unless recording. This is to reduce the chance of infections for you and all future guests.</p>


<h2>Studio Capacity</h2>


<p>Studio live room and control room capacity will be significantly reduced to ensure that artists, musicians, engineers, producers and composers observe the current US Government social distancing guidelines.</p>
