<h1>Working Safely at Soma Sounds during COVID 19</h1>

<h2>Yellow Phase Guidelines</h2>


<p>The government mandated operation outlines ask businesses to work remotely whenever possible. (Please send in mixes for remote work unless you need to come in to record a new project.) Every employee will be screened before each shift and high touch surface will be disinfected every few hours (if not more often). Maximum of 5 people per 1,000 sqft of space </p>


<h2>What you need to know before coming to the studios</h2>


<p>Soma staff clean and disinfect the studios and booth areas on a regular basis between every session. Artists and guests are asked to arrive and comtinue wearing face masks unless recording. This is to reduce the chance of infections for you and all future guests.</p>


<h2>Studio Capacity</h2>


<p>Studio live room and control room capacity will be significantly reduced to ensure that artists, musicians, engineers, producers and composers observe the current US Government social distancing guidelines.</p>
