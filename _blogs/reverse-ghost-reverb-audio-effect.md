Reverb is used in most songs we hear today. Its adds volume to a vocal by putting it in a space - think about the sound of singing in the bathroom compared to HUGE sound of an announcer in a sports stadium. These locations create their own natural reverb

Thanks to modern software, audio engineers are about to digitally re-create a variety of spaces by adding reverb to a sound. But there MUCH more we can do that simply adding space. There are more unique effects like what I call the**Reverse Ghost Reverb**. You have have heard this **sound effect** used in movies to depict the way a ghost would talk.

It is difficult to describe whats going on without hearing it so before you read further, consider taking a listen to this demo on <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/CbGy2qIvqC4?feature=share" target="Watch on YouTube">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sounds_like_soma/video/7137440670041640238?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7164488931840263722" target="Watch on TikTok">TikTok</a>!

## Instructions for Reverse Ghost Reverb Audio Effect

Here are typed out instructions on how to create this effect for yourself on your own DAW. This method will work on any digital audio workstation with any reverb audio effect plugin at your disposal.

- Start by duplicating a vocal on an audio track, and cutting out everything except for the beginning word or syllable that you want the effect on.
- Consolidate to the grid. 
- Reverse it the dry sound
- Throw a BIG reverb on it.  All the way wet. Turn up the reverb time. A longer tail give you more flexibility to shorten or manipulate it later on.
- Now, solo and export just this sound and bring it back into your program (If you are using Ableton Live, you can freeze and flatten that track instead of exporting it.
- Reverse that audio and line it up in front of the original recording.
- Now you have a cool fade in build-up effect for your vocals
