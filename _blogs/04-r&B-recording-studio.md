Philadelphia has strong roots in R&B music. We are always on the lookout for new talent that will continue Philly's musical legacy.

## Soulful Rhythm and Blues

Here at <a href="/services/01-recording-studios/" target="Recording Studios">Sounds Like Soma</a> recording studios, we work with all genres of music. That said, one of my favorites to work with is **R&B** because of the feelings it evokes, and the smooth vocal tones that accompany it.

We recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbfmX-rWPN/?hl=en" target="Instagram">showcased out artist, Juice Elliott, on Instagram</a>, who masterfully combines rap, r&b, and indie pop in his latest releases.
