## Music Rehearsal FAQ

### Can I bring my own drum kit?

Yes, of course you can, no matter how big it is. Also, consider only bringing the essentials like your snare drum or favorite cymbals to save you the hassle of lugging around a full kit.

### Can I bring my photographer?

We don not mind if you bring along a few guests to your music rehearsal. Or you can consider hiring a member of our trusted team for photography or videography as well. We have 4k cameras, professional lighting, and backdrops available to make you look your best.

### Can we extend our music rehearsal studio session?

As long as the studio space is available, you can always add more time to an already booked session. The only way to guarantee a time slot is to put down a deposit - so someone could book their rehearsal right after yours if you do not reserve it sooner rather than later.

### Are there any noise issues with neighbors?

The building and room are insulated so there are little to no noise issues from neighbors. We do ask that people schedule in advance for rehearsal time to avoid the occasional studio noise conflicts. For some podcasts or audio book recordings, we will make the rehearsal space unavailable to book to avoid any background noise creeping into the recordings.
