## FAQ

### Do you have Corporate Business Podcasting Experience?

Corporate expertise - Working on a podcast for your business? Let us guide your team in best practices from start to finish to obtain the clearest sound possible. After you are done recording, our editing team will make your voice 'pop' and condense any unwanted pauses or vocal hichups. Broadcast standards are constantly exolving, so let us take the wheel and elevate your company's voice to get you sounding your best!

### I'm new to podcasting, any tips?

Quick tips - Write down topics ahead of time and have extras just in case the episode moves at a quicker pace than expected. Do your best to avoid dead air, but know that we are always able to edit anything out you don not like. It is common to want to drink or smoke to shake off nervous jitters, but try not to get too inebriated (and definitely don't mix the 2).

We have a detailed blog (coming soon) covering podcast **creation** and equipment for beginners if you want to start your podcast journey outside of the studio.

We would love to work with you to grow your brand or ideas if you are new! You can <a href="https://squareup.com/appointments/buyer/widget/zkvz7h6ta6pudt/8GNV6PJ8WK7YH" target="Schedule A Tour">schedule a free consultation</a> by contacting one of the engineers. Or talk to us after your first podcast episode for an honest critique on what we think you should try out or improve on. 

### What's the longest running podcast you've worked on?

Some of our clients have completed 200+ episodes. Some have even expanded to doing live radio shows, both in our studio and on a radio near you. Check out the episode demos below to hear some of the longer running shows we currently work with.

### Are you able to travel?

We are able to travel for podcasts, interviews, and live broadcasting events upon request. Depending on the equipment needed, and the distance traveled, we will charge an additional fee. <a href="/contact/">Message Zack</a>, our expert **podcast producer**, to coordinate a good time to chat about where and when you plan to record your event.
