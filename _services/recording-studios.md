## Hip Hop Recording Studio

Due to our proximity in Philadelphia, we have the opportunity to work with the city's many great up and coming rappers, singers, and musicians. Especially in regards to RnB, this this studio has been able to explore new techniques and continue to adapt to fusing and growing genres. So when someone asks if were just another Philly hip hop recording studio, we can say that we do not define ourselves to just 1 style of music.

We work in all genres including Electronic, House, Funk, Alternative, Pop, Bluegrass, Gospel, and more! By working with such a variety of clients on a day to day basis, we are able to combine ideas and mixing techniques when it comes to producing a song. We work closely with out music clients to build a work of art the artist and out studio can be proud of. 

I hope that in the years to come, that we can all look back and see out contribution to the 'Philly Sound'.

## Music Recording Studios

Our building houses 4 fully equipped music recording studios that are specially designed depending on your needs. Aside from Studio A and Studio B described above, we have Studio D which is a live room, podcast space, rehearsal studio, and live performance space (like a tiny desk concert). When you book studio time through us, we have access to every room and will move the session accordingly to best suit the needs of your session. 

## FAQ

**Can I book a day session?**

A full day session is a 10 hour block with a discount on the price. Buy 9 hours and get 1 free in any of our recording rooms. Make sure you maximize your time by planning ahead. We are going to have a lot of time to get to work!

**How late can you record?**

Booking online only allows you to book until midnight, but we do offer later sessions for creative night owls. Prices do increase after midnight, but we are willing to stay as late as you want as long as the start time begins at or before midnight. So, no sessions starting at 3am, but we will have sessions from 12am-6am if you schedule it starting at or before midnight.

**Are you just another Philly Rap Studio?**

We have a lot of experience working with Pop, Rock, R&B, Electronic and of course, Hip-Hop music. We believe having a broad palate gives us a competitive advantage when experimenting with different effects or mixing techniques. We will do our best to make your music stand out among the thousands of daily releases. Our **recording studios** are a cut above the rest.
