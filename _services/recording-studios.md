## FAQ

**Can I book a day session?**

A full day session is a 10 hour block with a discount on the price -buy 9 hours and get 1 free. Make sure you maximize your time by planning ahead. We are going to have a lot of time to get to work!

**How late can you record?**

Booking online only allows you to book until midnight, but we do offer later sessions for creative night owls. Prices do increase after midnight, but we are willing to stay as late as you want as long as the start time begins at or before midnight. So, no sessions starting at 3am, but we will have sessions from 12am-6am if you schedule it starting at or before midnight.

**Are you just another Philly Rap Studio?**

We have a lot of experience working with Pop, Rock, R&B, Electronic and of course, Hip-Hop music. We believe having a broad palate gives us a competitive advantage when experimenting with different effects or mixing techniques. We will do our best to make your music stand out among the thousands of daily releases. Our **recording studios** are a cut above the rest.
