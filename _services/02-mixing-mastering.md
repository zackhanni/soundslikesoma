## Mixing & Mastering FAQ

**What is Mixing?**

Mixing is typically cleaning up many audio tracks - for example adjusting volume, timing, adding EQ, compression, reverb, autotune or other methods that may characteristically change the sound of each recorded track.

Mixing has more creative opportunities to capture the artists vision. The goal is to transform many recorded files into a single cohesive and balanced whole.

**What is Mastering?**

Typically, when mastering, youre working with a single stereo file or just the master output of the mix.

Mastering is about sound quality and making the overall song as good or better than the competition on the radio now.

For some, mastering is about making the song AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE while maintaining the feeling, emotion and PUNCH that it was given in the mixing stage.
