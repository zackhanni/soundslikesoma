## FAQ

### What Files Do I Get Once We Are Finished Recording?

Unless otherwise specified ahead of time, we will give you high-quality WAV files - 24bit, 48,000 sample rate. Files will be available immediately at the conclusion of your session. We usually send files over WeTransfer or Google drive but can also give them to you firstly if you bring along a hard drive with you to your **voice over studio** session.

### Is It Voice-over, Voiceover, or Voice Over?

Proper spelling of voice-over is the subject of much debate int he industry. While voice over may trigger your spellcheck to go off, professionals in the industry will understand the meaning behind it regardless of how you spell it. Voice Over is an acceptable way of spelling it as long as both words are capitalized. The Cambridge Oxford Dictionary recognizes the hyphen use of voice-over to be correct although visually it may seem unnatural to some.

### How Much Can I Make From Voiceover Work?

The cost of a voiceover work is determined by a wide range of variables. Significant influencing elements include:

- Word count: The longer the script, the more expensive it will be.
- Usage: The cost will be greatly impacted by how the voiceover is used.
- Experience: More established voice performers get more fees than emerging talent
- Revisions: The price will depend on how many times you need your work revised.

The price of voice acting is influenced by outside variables including inflation, economic health, and demand, just like any other sector.
You may message your talent to get more detailed information about your task or look at the Project Marketplace to see what other talent is charging for comparable jobs.
