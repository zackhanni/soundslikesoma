## FAQ

**Do you have Corporate Business Podcasting Experiance?**

Corporate expertise - Working on a podcast for your business? Let us guide your team in best practices from start to finish to obtain the clearest sound possible. After you are done recording, our editing team will make your voice 'pop' and condense any unwanted pauses or vocal hichups. Broadcast standards are constantly exolving, so let us take the wheel and elevate your company's voice to get you sounding your best!

**I'm new to podcasting, any tips?**

Quick tips - Write down topics ahead of time and have extras just in case the episode moves at a quicker pace than expected. Do your best to avoid dead air, but know that we are always able to edit anything out you don not like. It is common to want to drink or smoke to shake off nervous jitters, but try not to get too inebriated (and definitely don't mix the 2).

We would love to work with you to grow your brand or ideas if you are new!
