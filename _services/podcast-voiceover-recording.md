## Podcast Recording FAQ

**Can I perform with an audience while livestreaming? Tiny desk Style?**

Our **podcast rooms** can accommodate both small and large productions. We would love to help plan that for you! We have housed several successful tiny desks and album release party style events with guests and live music while recording everything that happens for later promotion, polishing, and release to video streaming platforms.

**I'm new to podcasting, can you give me tips?**

Quick tips - Write down topics ahead of time and have extras just in case the episode moves at a quicker pace than expected. Do your best to avoid dead air, but know that we are always able to edit anything out you don not like. It is common to want to drink or smoke to shake off nervous jitters, but try not to get too inebriated (and definitely don't mix the 2).

We would love to work with you to grow your brand or ideas if you are new! You can <a href="https://squareup.com/appointments/buyer/widget/zkvz7h6ta6pudt/8GNV6PJ8WK7YH" target="Schedule A Tour">schedule a free consultation</a> by contacting one of the engineers. Or talk to us after your first podcast episode for an honest critique on what we think you should try out or improve on. 

**What's the longest running podcast you've worked on?**

Some of our clients have completed 200+ episodes. Some have even expanded to doing live radio shows, both in our studio and on a radio near you.

**Are you able to travel to record our podcast?**

We are able to travel for podcasts, interviews, and live broadcasting events upon request. Depending on the equipment needed, and the distance traveled, we will charge an additional fee.
