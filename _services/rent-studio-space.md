There will always be 2 speakers, an audio interface, and a microphone there for use. Sometimes we do swap out equipment between studios, but you can always ask if you have a favorite piece of gear.

### Will people be walking in and out of the room while I'm working?

No, this is a private room with its own entrance and bathroom. The only time someone will walk in is if you request help or there is some kind of emergency.

We now offer discounts on day, week, and month sessions.
