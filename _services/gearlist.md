## How Much Is Recording Studio Equipment?

There are so many versions of the same equipment at various price points. A complete basic studio setup may cost around $500, while a medium setup may cost 30 thousand or more. High-End recording studio setups could cost in the hundreds of thousands to the millions.

Keep in mind that you do not need the best equipment to make good music. The right mic can help capture crisper high end and a cleaner low end, but at the end of the day, a good catchy song is going to be catchy regardless of what mic you use. Especially for those just getting started, do not let lack of equipment stop you from recording vocals or your instrument.
