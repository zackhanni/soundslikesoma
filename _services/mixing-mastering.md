Exporting track stems may not be a difficult task, but it is time consuming to do correctly (especially for multiple songs). Thats why we charge a small fee to fully export stems when its outside of booked studio time. 

Please specify ahead of time if you want **dry** or **wet** stem exports

## Mixing & Mastering FAQ

**What is Mixing?**

Mixing is typically cleaning up many audio tracks - for example adjusting volume, timing, adding EQ, compression, reverb, autotune or other methods that may characteristically change the sound of each recorded track.

Mixing has more creative opportunities to capture the artists vision. The goal is to transform many recorded files into a single cohesive and balanced whole.

Head engineer Zack wrote about mixing and mastering in more detail over in our <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/what-is-mastering.html" target="what is mastering">studio blog</a>. Check it out!

**What is Mastering?**

Typically, when mastering, youre working with a single stereo file or just the master output of the mix.

Mastering is about sound quality and making the overall song as good or better than the competition on the radio now.

For some, mastering is about making the song AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE while maintaining the feeling, emotion and PUNCH that it was given in the mixing stage. Check out this iZotope article to <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/what-is-mastering.html" target="what is mastering">Learn More about mastering</a>

**I want my song AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE!**

If that's what you want we will do it, but there are a few things you should know. Streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify turn down loud songs on their platform to -14 LUFS to make volumes across songs sound more even. 

You may actually be hurting your music by making it too loud because it loses punch and power compared to less compressed songs at the same LUFS level. Audio equipment retailer Sweetwater has <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/what-is-lufs-and-why-should-i-care/" target="What is lufs and why should I care">long but thorough article covering LUFS</a> in more detail.

Mastering is the final step in bringing your recording to its potential. It gives your music the professional, commercial quality necessary to compete nationally and globally. Make sure your next song is radio-ready --  you never know who's listening!
