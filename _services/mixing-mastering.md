## What is mixing and mastering?

Mixing and mastering is a process to achieve musical and tonal balance. Typically, mixing audio stems usually has significant and obvious changes while song mastering is a more subtle art with broad changes that effect the entire song.

The mixing process has more opportunity for creativity to capture the artists vision, while mastering focuses on sound quality and making your song competitive to songs on the radio or streaming platforms.

## Mixing Mastering FAQ

### What is Music Mixing?

This is a complicated topic, in short - mixing is typically cleaning up many audio tracks. For example, adjusting volume, timing, adding EQ, compression, reverb, autotune or other methods that may characteristically change the sound of each recorded track.

Mixing has more creative opportunities to capture the artists vision. The goal is to transform many recorded files into a single cohesive and balanced whole.

### What is Music Mastering?

Typically, when mastering, you are working with a single stereo file or just the master output of the mix.

Mastering is about sound quality and making the overall song as good or better than the competition on the radio now.

For some, mastering is about making the song AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE while maintaining the feeling, emotion and PUNCH that it was given in the mixing stage. 

### What if I want my song AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE!!

If maximum loudness is your goal, we can make it happen, but you should know there may be trade offs. Streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify turn down loud songs on their platform to -14 LUFS to make volumes across songs sound more even. 

You may actually be hurting your music by making it too loud because it loses punch and power compared to less compressed songs at the same LUFS level. Visit the studio for a live demo.

Mastering is the final step in bringing your recording to its potential. It gives your music the professional, commercial quality necessary to compete nationally and globally. Make sure your next song is radio-ready --  you never know who's listening!
